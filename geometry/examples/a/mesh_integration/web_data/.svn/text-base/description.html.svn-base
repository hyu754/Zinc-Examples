This example reads a model consisting of all the standard 3-D element shapes.

It defines Gauss points for a certain order Gaussian Quadrature Scheme and sums their weights multiplied by dV or dA (differential volume or area at the Gauss point) to calculate the total volume and surface area of the mesh.
